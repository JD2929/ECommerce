# ECommerce

##Purpose of needing such an application

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, plays a significant role within the electronics industry, as it empowers businesses and consumers alike to conveniently engage in online buying and selling of electronic products. In the latest available data from 2021, the industry in the United States alone was estimated to have generated a substantial amount of US$2.54 trillion, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

## Installation

Due to the fact that there is no "front end" to this particular application, you must be running it in VS Code. Please ensure that you have initialized and started your server as well as the database so you will need mysql on your machine. 
in CLI type the following
> mysql -uroot -p
> password: "Type your password here"
> source db/schema.sql;
> exit

You will be back in the VSCode command line.

To seed the database in the CLI
node seeds/index.js

Now you will need to start the server 

npm start
